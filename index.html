    <img src= "IMG_5835.jpeg" width = "200" alt = "Mother and son photo."/>
    <p> 
      After graduating high school and maturing a little, I became very passionate about self-improvement and intensive learning/working routines. I also soon realized I needed a high-paying job. After weeks of research, I found coding to be the most fitting considering my love for work ethic and routine. Now that I've had the hands-on experience I know I made the right decision. Not only is it studious but it's kind of fun! On top of that, I've already met a few like-minded software developers and cant wait to meet more!
